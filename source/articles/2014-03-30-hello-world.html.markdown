Hello there my *pair* of english non-regular readers that somehow ended up here!

I installed [this cool i18n plugin for Jekyll](https://github.com/liamzebedee/jekyll-i18n) that will let me write posts in multiple languages! Yay!

I still need to make the dates translations work. So I'll be doing that now.

And, welcome, welcome to my blog, I hope you find yourself at home, take a seat over there, I'll bring you tea and biscuits, enjoy yourself, my blog is your blog.

  Hey, my name is **Ezequiel Adrian Schwartzman**, I'm an *electronics engineer student by day, and web developer by night*. Online I'm refered to as **Zequez**, and some people also call me that in real life. I live in Mar del Plata, **Argentina**, and as clich√© as it sounds, *I like to make stuff*.

  As you can see there are many ways to get in touch with me. If neither of those work, you can try smoke signals near my house, or sending a homing pigeon. I don't tweet.

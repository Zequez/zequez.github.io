%h2 About me

  Hey, my name is **Ezequiel Adrian Schwartzman**, I'm an *informatics engineer
  student by day, and web developer by night*. Online I'm refered to as **Zequez**,
  and some people also call me that in real life. I live in Mar del Plata, **Argentina**,
  and as clich√© as it sounds, *I really just like to make stuff*.

  My strongest skills are Rails and Front-end stuff (all JS/CSS/HTML), mostly working with React now.
  You can check the [projects I made](/projects) to see the kind of stuff you can expect me to be able to do.

  As a person I strive for efficiency in my life, yet my greatest enemy is procrastination. My friends
  describe me as excitable, and my parents think I'm smart (disappointingly, college taught me otherwise).
  I prefer my coffee black and my *mate* bitter, this way I don't need neither milk nor sugar.

  If you need something done, and I have the skills to do it, and you're willing to pay for it,
  at a price that I'm willing to accept, then you might want to...

<p>There is no pic, and Wayback Machine doesn&#39;t have anything.
But <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Zequez/posts/117114628363959">I have this Facebook post I made</a>
public, cheerfully announcing a cool 3D effect I had made for the 404 page, in Spanish, of course.</p>

<h2>Since there is no pic, here is a thousand words</h2>

<p>At the time I was really into watching series online, but I struggled with following the release
dates for the new episodes, the new seasons and the actual air time (with the following torrent-time).</p>

<p>So I decided to make something to solve this issue, of course, no time to check Wikipedia to see when
the new episodes are going to air.</p>

<p>With this project I learned Regular Expressions. I scraped a website called <a href="http://tvrage.com/">TVRage</a> for all the series
information. At the time that website seemend to have a pretty good authority, so I picked it.</p>

<p>The plan was to make some kind of interactive timeline with the release dates of episodes of each serie. I actually don&#39;t
remember how far I got into making the interactive timeline. But it would have been pretty cool I guess.</p>

<h2>What happened?</h2>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t recall why I abandoned it exactly, I think I found a similar tool that already existed.
I also recall that after a while I found <a href="http://showrss.info/">Karmorra RSS, now called showrss.info</a> and I stopped
worrying about the release dates of series, since they would just download automatically and worry-free,
and my torrent client would anounce me when it was available to watch. That website it&#39;s kick-ass!</p>

<p>So yeah, no intention on continuing with this project ever again.</p>

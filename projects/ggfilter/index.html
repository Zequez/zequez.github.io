<p>Alright, so, what <em>IS</em> GGFilter? GGFilter aims to be the ultimate
filterable database of games that allow you to find <em>Good Games</em>.</p>

<p>Right now it&#39;s a filterable database of Steam games, but I want to
include other stores like Oculus Home, GOG, The Humble Store, Origin. In that order.</p>

<h2>The interface design</h2>

<p>The current design is the one in the picture above. The original design was the
one below.</p>

<p><img alt="wide" src="/projects/ggfilter-v0.png" /></p>

<p>After posting it on Reddit and getting some feedback on it&#39;s user <em>un</em>friendliness,
I decided to make a complete redesign.</p>

<p>The new design roughly follows the Material Design guidelines, and differently from
the original it also works on mobile.</p>

<h2>Original idea</h2>

<p>The idea started a few years ago with <a href="/projects/playtime-for-the-buck">PlaytimeForTheBuck</a>,
I just wanted to be able to sort games by the amount of average playing time
divided by the price. (I extracted this data from Steam reviews which are accompanied
by the amount of hours the reviewer played)</p>

<p>Anyway, that thing worked as a pure front end app. The whole database was being compressed
into a .json file and downloaded for each user. It was crazy, and I had it hosted on the
Github pages system, which I thought it was kinda clever at the time since I didn&#39;t
have to pay a dime, but afterwards I started to feel a little bad about abusing the system.
I never put any ads and it was open source tho, so it wasn&#39;t really THAT bad.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>The new app, renamed to GGFilter, is divided in 3 different projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scrapers</li>
<li>Client</li>
<li>Server</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>scrapers</strong> live on their own Ruby gem and are a server dependency. It has different submodules for each type of scraping; games list, game pages and reviews from Steam, and video cards benchmarks (for the system requirements index),</p>

<p>The Rails <strong>server</strong> works mostly as an API and has the Rake tasks to run the different scrapers on cronjobs. Right now it also serves the whole <em>client</em> as a bundle (the client has a task that bundles itself into a Gem that is also required by the server).</p>

<p>The <strong>client</strong> is made with React+Redux and it communicates with the server through the API. There is no server rendering right now (and thus zero SEO), but in the future I want to make the client also a Node rendering server, and the Rails server just a pure API. But I don&#39;t want to spend more money on Heroku right now.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>

<p>From a pragmatic point of view, at the moment it just looks pretty on my portfolio
really. For me it&#39;s a really fun playground to try out new new things, specially
in the front end.</p>

<p>In the future, as I wrote above, I would like to add other stores. I would like
to allow people to save and name filters (right now the filters are sharable but aren&#39;t
saved on the server, are encoded into the URL), get notifications when the filter
results change. I would like to make automated articles with top games
filters (think SEO). I would like to make a statistics section on the app to
create and publish interesting statistics about games (think /r/dataisbeautiful).
I would like to add other interesting things like data from Steam curators, and
easy access to popular &quot;let&#39;s play&quot; videos from YouTube next to the results.</p>

<p>In short, there is plenty of room for improvement!</p>

<p>And if you excuse me, I have to go publish this article and go job/gig hunting.</p>

<h2>That looks awesome! What is it though?</h2>

<p>I know, I know, the best thing since sliced bread, right? Well, initially
when Steam started the reviews system, I saw that they included the playing time of the person for each
review. So I though, <em>&quot;wouldn&#39;t it be nice to see the average playing time for every game?&quot;</em>
and if you divide it by the price of the game, you can see... the <em>playtime for the buck</em>.</p>

<p>The idea was to scrap all the games and  all the reviews and make a database with them, then I could
analyze the data and sort it however I wanted! I ended up adding much more than playtime/buck, you can
filter and sort games in multiple ways. Want to check the
<a href="http://playtimeforthebuck.com/best-reviews/#tags=rpg&amp;sale=0~">best rated RPG games, with more than 50 reviews, that cost less than 5 dollars, and are on sale</a>, done.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a data-fan so when I look at that big-ass table with
unlimited filters and sorting mechanisms, the sheer density and the ease of accessibility of the data
makes me puke rainbows.</p>

<h2>How was it done?</h2>

<p>This is my favorite part, the whole system runs as a static page. I feel guilty for
abusing the Github pages, but hey, I&#39;m not putting any ads, and I&#39;m not targeting profits yet,
so I guess it&#39;s OK.</p>

<h3>The scraper</h3>

<p>The scrapping it&#39;s done with a Ruby gem, <a href="https://github.com/PlaytimeForTheBuck/ptb-scrapper">PTB-Scrapper</a>,
it would be unfair to call it a script. And yes, I do realize I misspelled scraper, and added an extra <em>p</em>, but
when it was too late when the first guy pointed it out.</p>

<p>The the scraped data is stored on a SQLite database, and then it&#39;s converted to a single <em>json</em> file for
the front end to use.</p>

<p>The actual Ruby gem creates a few rake tasks to facilitate the scraping of all the things. I don&#39;t want to
go into too much detail, but the source it&#39;s there.</p>

<h3>The front end</h3>

<p>OK I kind of messed up with this one? Why, you might ask? Well multiple reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Error 1: I decided to use Jekyll to build it</li>
<li>Error 2: I decided to not use any front end framework</li>
<li>Error 3: I didn&#39;t write any tests</li>
</ul>

<p>So the whole front end infrastructure it&#39;s hanging from a thread, that&#39;s why
I want to rewrite it and make it more solid. At least I separated everything with classes.</p>

<p>It works like this. It loads a single page, and then it loads the <em>big-ass</em> JSON file from the
server. And then it just works like a regular front end app. There are many quirks, like the handling
of the URL, since I tried to make some pre-rendering for SEO purposes, which worked pretty well, I mean
I&#39;m not sure if it helped the SEO, but the pre-rendering worked.</p>

<h3>The builder</h3>

<p>A third project? Yes, a third project.</p>

<p>The builder takes care of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Includes the scraper and the front end as gems</li>
<li>Runs the cronjobs to get the data and build the front end</li>
<li>Pre-renders the front page, and other pages with pre-made searches with pretty URLs using PhantomJS</li>
<li>Commits the generated page to the static page</li>
<li>Pushes the static page to Github</li>
</ul>

<h2>What happened?</h2>

<p>Well I didn&#39;t make a lot of publicity, I posted it in a few relevant subreddits, and it got a pretty good reception
and I always comment with a link if I find someone asking for something that PlaytimeForTheBuck solves.</p>

<p>I kind of let it go for a while, I just have a cronjob running in my personal computer that takes care of updating.
Last week I realized that I was starting to get a pretty good amount of visits! On May it hit 1k! And June 1.6k!
And then I realized it was mostly spam traffic from some russian sites, which was a bummer, but hey,
the good Reddit reception was still there.</p>

<h2>What are the plans?</h2>

<p>I want to rewrite it with a legitimate back-end, probably Rails, and a solid front-end framework, which I&#39;m still
undecided, I did have experience with Angular in my last job, but I don&#39;t really like it too much, and I need
something really fast.</p>

<p>I want to add features like data from different stores, system requirements for games,
average value of steam cards, a top-list review system for SEO purposes and getting the name out there!</p>

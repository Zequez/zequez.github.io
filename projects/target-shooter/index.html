<h2>So what&#39;s this thing about?</h2>

<p>Target Shooter, initially called BlindMice (thus the URL) was a game I made
when learning Canvas. I think it also was my first experience with JavaScript OOP too,
although if you look at the code you can see that I was doing it wrong, since I was
using classes but without prototyping, at least I got one thing right haha.</p>

<p>The inspiration for the game was a flash game I had played a looong time ago that you
basically had to click targets, but you couldn&#39;t see your mouse.</p>

<p>I published the game as a Facebook game, but I half-assed
that part, as many parts of the game, <em>it&#39;s pretty buggy</em>. But I actually got a pretty
good reception from comments on ChromeExperiments, except for the bugs.</p>

<h3>How do you play it?</h3>

<p>You basically find yourself in a canvas, and different targets appear, and you have to click them
to &quot;shoot&quot; them. You have a limited time to clear the targets after they appear, if you miss the time window you lose,
and if you missclick a target you lose points. The game also have different stages that are selected randomly.</p>

<h3>Stages</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Normal stage:</strong> Targets just appear one by one on the screen, you lose if you miss the time window.</li>
<li><strong>Blind stage:</strong> Same as normal stage, but you can&#39;t see your mouse.</li>
<li><strong>Moving stage:</strong> The targets cross the screen from the border, if you miss it you lose.</li>
<li><strong>Ramification-target stage:</strong> First target it&#39;s alone, then 2 targets appear, then 3 targets, then 4 targets. You also lose if you miss the time window.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What could be improved?</h3>

<p>Adding more variety to stages, hitting streaks, an online leaderboard, and playing analysis
for statistics purposes, and for A/B testing. And getting rid of the bugs. Also, I could rewrite it in CoffeeScript.</p>

<h3>What does the future holds?</h3>

<p>Not much, really, I thought about making an Android spinoff of the game, but I don&#39;t know
how to Android yet, it&#39;s one of the things in my bucket list.</p>

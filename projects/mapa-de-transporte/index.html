<h2>A little bit about the project</h2>

<p>Mapa de Transporte was my first serious Rails project. Back when I was working on this,
I was on a limbo-year between school and university, so I had plenty of freetime to learn
a new language and a new framework.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>I live in Mar del Plata, a city in Argentina, and we have a seriously shitty public transport,
and I noticed there wasn&#39;t any good place to see all the buses routes in a easy fashion,
to know which buses to take. So I decided to create one, and
Mapa de Transporte was the result of that idea.</p>

<h3>What does it do?</h3>

<p>The app lets you see all the routes at the same time, and instantly find the closest buses to connect 2 points in the city. I&#39;m a data freak, that&#39;s why I tried made all the data easily accessible and visible at the same time. The app also let&#39;s you set the distance you&#39;re willing to walk to filter buses. And it displays all the charging spots to recharge the bus card in the whole city.</p>

<p>The app also has a backend that lets you administer all the buses and buses routes. For the
most part it was made with <a href="http://activeadmin.info/">ActiveAdmin</a> although with some heavy
JavaScripting for the routes editor.</p>

<p><img alt="wide" src="/projects/mapa-de-transporte-backend.png" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the backend route editor. The bus-company website provided
a list of streets that the bus crossed, so I pasted the list on the box there, and
the script tried to highlight the street I had the caret on. This way I could add the
route with less effort. All the routes were added manually, was a colossal work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>What happened?</h3>

<p>I learned a lot from this app, Rails, CoffeeScript, Google Maps, complex front-end
organization, you name it!</p>

<p>And while it still receives around 8k hits per month,
and it has a pretty decent Google positioning, I&#39;m not currently very interested on
continue the development, the last update was in 2013. There are many alternatives now,
even mobile, so is not such a critical issue as it was :).</p>

<h3>What is the plan for the future?</h3>

<p>I might update it in the future, but in reality, what I really want is a
complete rewrite. You see, back then, I didn&#39;t use any front-end framework to make
the app, and although I got pretty decent at separating everything in CoffeeScript classes,
I&#39;ll probably cringe a lot if I look at the code. And I want to learn React,
so it might just be the excuse I need to start with it. There were multiple things that
I wanted to implement but I didn&#39;t, so there is that.</p>

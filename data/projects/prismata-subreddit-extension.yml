  ## An extension, you say?
  
  Yes, a Chrome extension to be precise. [This wasn't my first experience with Chrome
  extensions](http://localhost:4567/2011/04/04/facebook-open-all), but with this one
  was the first one a little polished.
  
  ### Prismata? What is that?
  
  Well, [Prismata](http://prismata.net/) is an excelent online cards game without random elements, so it's all
  about startegy and player skills. It got funded on Kickstarter, and they say it's gonna
  be free, but they haven't made a public version yet, although you can play the demo, which
  is just the same as the real deal, but a single-player experience against the computer.

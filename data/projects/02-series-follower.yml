  ## Since there is no pic, here is a thousand words
  
  At the time I was really into watching series online, but I struggled with following the release
  dates for the new episodes, the new seasons and the actual air time (with the following torrent-time).
  
  So I decided to make something to solve this issue, of course, no time to check Wikipedia to see when
  the new episodes are going to air.
  
  With this project I learned Regular Expressions. I scraped a website called [TVRage](http://tvrage.com/) for all the series
  information. At the time that website seemend to have a pretty good authority, so I picked it.
  
  The plan was to make some kind of interactive timeline with the release dates of episodes of each serie. I actually don't
  remember how far I got into making the interactive timeline. But it would have been pretty cool I guess.
  
  ## What happened?
  
  Well, I don't recall why I abandoned it exactly, I think I found a similar tool that already existed.
  I also recall that after a while I found [Karmorra RSS, now called showrss.info](http://showrss.info/) and I stopped
  worrying about the release dates of series, since they would just download automatically and worry-free,
  and my torrent client would anounce me when it was available to watch. That website it's kick-ass!
  
  So yeah, no intention on continuing with this project ever again.

  ## What was this?
  
  The intention of Comicsen was to build a website to translate webcomics to different languages. I was mostly
  translating from English to Spanish.
  
  ### Etymology
  
  - Comics = Comics
  - En = In (in Spanish)
  
  So the idea was to do something like ComicsEn/Spanish ComicsEn/English, etc.
  
  ### The idea
  
  Well, at the time I read a lot of webcomics, during the golden age of Google Reader. And the problem
  was that I couldn't share with my friends on Facebook because most of my friends couldn't understand
  English very well. So I decided it would be a great idea to translate them so everyone could enjoy the
  comics I enjoyed.
  
  ### Features
  
  The website featured a built-in JavaScript editor in the backend to translate the comics. It allowed you
  to erase the text in the comics, and add your own text. The idea was to make it easy to translate the comics.

  It also had a blog-like listing of the comics, with special pages for each comic, with a bar of % of translated
  comics and stats like % of non-translatable jokes. It also featured a voting system for the comics.
  
  One of the most interesting things about the website was that the scraping of the comics was done automatically
  with a PHP script and a Cronjob. Building Comicsen I mastered the art of Regular Expressions, and I also got a liking
  of scraping websites, which I also did in later projects.
  
  All of these things were made mostly from scratch, since I didn't know plugins for CodeIgniter were a thing.
  
  ### What happened?
  
  Like most of my projects, I lost interest after a while and abandoned it.
  I think I translated around a few hundred comics. The visits peaked at around 1200
  visits per month, on July 2012, and that was *way* after I had abandoned.
  Thinking back, the project might have had potential, and I could have
  probably made it grow if I had been more persistent. But I wasn't.
  
  This year I shut it down, since I canceled my hosting subscription, since I don't work with PHP anymore, and my blog
  was moved to be statically hosted on Github now (it was on Wordpress).
  
  ### What do you see in the future?
  
  I'm not sure. As I said, thinking back, it could have worked great if I had been persistent
  with the translations. But that train already left, so I'll probably just let it go,
  I have tons of other ideas to work with right now. Besides I would have to do
  it from scratch, since I there is *now way* I'm touching PHP again.

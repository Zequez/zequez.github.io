  ## Yes, I'm talking about this blog
  
  At first zequez.com was a Wordpress blog. Then I saw that all the cool kids were using
  the Github static pages system, so I moved to Jekyll to do that. It's pretty cool.
  
  I don't have any pictures of the first Wordpress blog, but it was just a shitty pre-made theme
  (no offense to the author intended), so it doesn't matter. Then I migrated to Jekyll and the result
  was the following picture:

  > Oh god why so much green!?
  
  I don't know man, I just like the color green, OK?
  
  The old blog featured stuff like internationalization, and a fancy easter egg, and
  animations and convulsion-causing colors and flashing pictures. After I didn't like it anymore
  I decided to re-do the design, but now I would keep it as simple as possible, and the result was
  the current design.
  
  Not only I made a new design, but I also changed the whole builder, now it's using Middleman instead of
  Jekyll. The advantage is that Middleman it's much more flexible, robust, and has a bigger community.
  
  ## Why a blog?
  
  I like to write about stuff I do, and while I would like for all my projects to be profitable, for now
  I'm planning on getting some web-dev jobs done, so I needed a portfolio to showcase my personal projects.
  
  ## What were the results?
  
  What? I don't know, I haven't even pushed this yet, why are you asking this?
  
  ## What are the plans for this website?
  
  Well, I'll try to keep it updated, and I want to get some critics from actual designers.

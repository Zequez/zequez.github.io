  It's alright, you can take your time to amaze at the sheer beauty of the project.
  Take a deep breath, and relax. I know, I know, I love it too!

  But seriously, I really put a lot of effort on the design, and learned a few new things
  in the process. I don't like to use CSS frameworks because I always end up touching it up
  just to my liking, so everything is hand crafted with SASS.

  [Factorio](http://factorio.com/) is an automation game where you land on a planet and have to
  build automated stuff. I love it too, that's why I made the app.

  The app currently still lives in [factoriomods.com](http://factoriomods.com) (yeah, I snatched
  the domain really soon), but it's in the process to be decommissioned, as there is an official
  mod database now, so I'll host it silently in a subdomain of this blog to be displayed here.

  ## Reception

  I think people liked it, I posted it on the forum and on the [Factorio subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/)
  and people seemed to like it.

  Afterwards I got in touch with the Factorio devs and they contracted me to make
  an [official web app and API](http://mods.factorio.com) as they already had a plan to do it.

  ## So what's this thing about?
  
  Target Shooter, initially called BlindMice (thus the URL) was a game I made
  when learning Canvas. I think it also was my first experience with JavaScript OOP too,
  although if you look at the code you can see that I was doing it wrong, since I was
  using classes but without prototyping, at least I got one thing right haha.
  
  The inspiration for the game was a flash game I had played a looong time ago that you
  basically had to click targets, but you couldn't see your mouse.
  
  I published the game as a Facebook game, but I half-assed
  that part, as many parts of the game, *it's pretty buggy*. But I actually got a pretty
  good reception from comments on ChromeExperiments, except for the bugs.
  
  ### How do you play it?
  
  You basically find yourself in a canvas, and different targets appear, and you have to click them
  to "shoot" them. You have a limited time to clear the targets after they appear, if you miss the time window you lose,
  and if you missclick a target you lose points. The game also have different stages that are selected randomly.
  
  ### Stages
  
  - **Normal stage:** Targets just appear one by one on the screen, you lose if you miss the time window.
  - **Blind stage:** Same as normal stage, but you can't see your mouse.
  - **Moving stage:** The targets cross the screen from the border, if you miss it you lose.
  - **Ramification-target stage:** First target it's alone, then 2 targets appear, then 3 targets, then 4 targets. You also lose if you miss the time window.
  
  ### What could be improved?
  
  Adding more variety to stages, hitting streaks, an online leaderboard, and playing analysis
  for statistics purposes, and for A/B testing. And getting rid of the bugs. Also, I could rewrite it in CoffeeScript.
  
  ### What does the future holds?
  
  Not much, really, I thought about making an Android spinoff of the game, but I don't know
  how to Android yet, it's one of the things in my bucket list.

  ## So what was this thing
  
  What if I told you there was a website were you could find an *unendless* stream of
  hand-picked (*by me*) funny pictures and videos? I know, *amazing*, *ground breaking*,
  you might think. Yes, this was qembole.com, your nonleading website for funny things.
  
  Of course I was really into funny stuff, and my friends liked it, so I did it. I was the
  coolest kid in the block.
  
  I think Qembole! was my first presentable PHP project. Such a shame that I lost everything
  in *The Great HDD Formatting Fuck-Up*, because I had made a blogging engine from scratch, which
  of course, was a complete pile of shit, but, hey, if it works, it works.
  
  One thing that surprised me, after I discovered the magic of web frameworks, was how close my
  engine architecture was to these frameworks (namely CodeIgniter). I had ended up with models, controllers, and views
  without knowing that MVC was actually a thing, and I actually remember that I made my own
  templating language, which doesn't make much sense because PHP is a pretty decent templating
  language on it's own.
  
  Damn I really wish I had those files *to show the grandkids* >_<. Hopefully *The Great HDD Formatting Fuck-Up*
  won't happen again since now I have everything on the great and amazing life-saving awesome stress-free Dropbox.

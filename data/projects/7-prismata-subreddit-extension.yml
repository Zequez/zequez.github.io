  ## An extension, you say?
  
  Yes, a Chrome extension to be precise. [This wasn't my first experience with Chrome
  extensions](http://localhost:4567/2011/04/04/facebook-open-all), but with this one
  was the first one a little polished.
  
  ## Prismata? What is that?
  
  Well, [Prismata](http://prismata.net/) is an excelent online cards game without random elements, so it's all
  about startegy and player skills. It got funded on Kickstarter, and they say it's gonna
  be free, but they haven't made a public version yet, although [you can play the demo](http://play.prismata.net/), which
  is just the same as the real deal, but a single-player experience against the computer.
  
  ## Why an extension?
  
  The [Prismata Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Prismata/) is used as the main
  community for the game, but the problem with the subreddit is that when you discuss
  cards of the game, it's pretty hard to know which card the person is talking about
  and let alone knowing the exact card attributes and effects!
  
  The extension solves this. It has the complete list of cards names, and while you
  browse the subreddit it searches for mentions of the cards so it can add a little
  icon next to it with the drawing of the card. These little icons are in the subreddit
  flails system. Also, when you hover the card name, it displays the complete card information,
  taken from the official Wiki.
  
  It also replaces IDs for match replays with links for the replays.
  
  ## What were the results?
  
  Well, the reception was pretty good, a lot of people liked it! And they even added a link to
  the extension in the sidebar of the subreddit! Pretty cool!
  
  Sadly, I didn't update it after a while, and I kind of abandoned it, multiple people PM me
  with things to update, and I just couldn't find the drive or the time, since after the summer
  I started college again. Right now I'm on winter break, so I wanted to make the update
  it deserved.
  
  ## What does the future holds?
  
  Well, I plan on maintaining the extension for now, like adding new cards, fixing bugs, but I
  don't have plans to add new features. Maybe after the game goes public and I actually
  play with friends or something, I might be more motivated.

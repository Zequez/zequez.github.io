    ## A little bit about the project
    
    Mapa de Transporte was my first serious Rails project. Back when I was working on this,
    I was on a limbo-year between school and university, so I had plenty of freetime to learn
    a new language and a new framework.
    
    I live in Mar del Plata, a city in Argentina, and we have a seriously shitty public transport,
    and I noticed there wasn't any good place to see all the buses routes in a easy fashion,
    to know which buses to take. So I decided to create one, and
    Mapa de Transporte was the result of that idea.
    
    The app lets you see all the routes at the same time, and instantly
    find the closest buses to connect 2 points in the city. I'm a data freak, that's
    why I tried made all the data easily accessible and visible at the same time.
    The app also let's you set the distance you're willing to walk to filter buses.
    And it displays all the charging spots to recharge the bus card in the whole city.
    
    I learned a lot from this app, and while it still receives around 8k hits per month,
    and it has a pretty decent Google positioning, I'm not currently very interested on
    continue the development, the last update was in 2013. There are many alternatives now,
    even mobile, so is not such a critical issue now :).
    
    However, I might update it in the future, but in reality, what I really want is a
    complete rewrite. You see, back then, I didn't use any front-end framework to make
    the app, and although I got pretty decent at separating everything in CoffeeScript classes,
    I'll probably cringe a lot if I look at the code. And I want to learn React,
    so it might just be the excuse I need to start with it. There were multiple things that
    I wanted to implement but I didn't, so there is that.

    # So what's this thing about?
    
    Target Shooter, initially called BlindMice (thus the URL) was a game I made
    when learning Canvas. I think it also was my first experience with JavaScript OOP too,
    although if you look at the code you can see that I was doing it wrong, since I was
    using classes but without prototyping, at least I got one thing right haha.
    
    The inspiration for the game was a flash game I had played a looong time ago that you
    basically had to click targets, but you couldn't see your mouse.
    
    Well, I actually published the game as a Facebook game, but I half-assed
    that part, as many parts of the game, *it's pretty buggy*. But I actually got a pretty
    good reception from comments on ChromeExperiments, except for the bugs.
    
    ## How do you play it?
    
    You basically find yourself in a canvas, and different targets appear, and you have to click them
    to "shoot" them. You have a limited time to clear the targets after they appear, if you miss the time window you lose,
    and if you missclick a target you lose points. The game also have different stages that are selected randomly.
    
    ### Stages
    
    - **Normal stage:** Targets just appear one by one on the screen, you lose if you miss the time window.
    - **Blind stage:** Same as normal stage, but you can't see your mouse.
    - **Moving stage:** The targets cross the screen from the border, if you miss it you lose.
    - **Ramification-target stage:** First target it's alone, then 2 targets appear, then 3 targets, then 4 targets. You also lose if you miss the time window.
    
    ## What could be improved?
    
    Adding more variety to stages, hitting streaks, an online leaderboard, and playing analysis
    for statistics purposes, and for A/B testing. And getting rid of the bugs. Also, I could rewrite it in CoffeeScript.
    
    ## What does the future holds?
    
    Not much, really, I thought about making an Android spinoff of the game, but I don't know
    how to Android yet, it's one of the things in my bucket list.

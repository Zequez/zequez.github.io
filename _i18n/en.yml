  about: Hi. I’m just another web developer. I’m an ingineering student. I’m an inventor. 
         I’m an entrepreneur. I’m a humanist. I’m not genius. I’m filled with defects. I get depressed and euphoric.
         I fall and I stand up. I go, an I come back. As human as any other, walking this strange world.

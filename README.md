Also, here is a list of plugins I'm using:

 - And [the image tag plugin is from this guy](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/jekyll-image-tag).
 - And [the assets pipeline plugin is from this guy](https://github.com/ixti/jekyll-assets). 
 - And [the i18n internationalization plugin is from this guy](https://github.com/liamzebedee/jekyll-i18n)
 - And [the i88n localization plugin to translate dates is from this guy](https://github.com/nelsonsar/jekyll-i18n-filter)

I touched (in a non-sexual way) some of those though. Whoo, open source!

And the pictures I don't remember anymore. Most of them are mine, but if there is a picture that looks like was taken from Google Images, then it's not OK to copy them, because using pictures from Google Images is not OK. I know that *now*, but I'm not willing to go find replacements for the pictures in my posts.

Also, you will find in `_design` the initial drafts from Photoshop. You are free to take em.

And you can take my page design, I mean, I wouldn't do it because is pretty basic, but you can. But don't sell it to anyone, you greedy bastard.

Also, the font [Montserrat is from Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat), copyright to the owner. I had to add it here because if the shitty rendering of the fonts on Chrome.

Also, `/sandbox/blindmice` is there for historical reasons, and I don't want to break any link to the game.

Also, here you have love <3, take it, because the world is a filled with horrible things. Specially peoplely-things.
